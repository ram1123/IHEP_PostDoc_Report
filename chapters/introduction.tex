\chapter{Introduction}
In this report, I am summarising the work done during the two and half year of my post-doctoral
position at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), Beijing between October 2022
and December 2024. I have primarily worked on three physics analysis.
They are
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resonant Di-Higgs search using the \HHWW channel
    \item High mass scalar searches in model independent way using the \XZZ and \XZZv channel
    \item Differential and fiducial cross-section measurement with Higgs to 4 lepton channel
    \item anomalous Triple Gauge Coupling aTGC studies using \WpWm channel
    \item Higgs mass measurement using \HGG channel
    \item VH production
    \item HGCal studies
    \item EFT studies
\end{itemize}
Apart from the physics analysis, I worked on following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item High level trigger developments of Electron and Photons
    \item Monte-carlo sample generation with Madgraph
\end{itemize}
In addition of these tasks, I also took some Detector Control System (DCS) shifts at P5, CMS as well
as several shifts at the HGCAL clean room.
