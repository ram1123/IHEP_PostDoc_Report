This report summarises the work done by Ram Krishna Sharma in the CMS group of the Institute of High Energy Physics, with Prof. Mingshui Chen, from December 2019 to June 2022. The main focus was on the double Higgs non-resonant production with fully Hadronic final state of WW$\gamma \gamma$, Higgs to 4 lepton differentical and fiducial cross-section measurement and vector boson scattering measurement with semi-leptonic WW final state. Other secondary project includes the studies with CPPF, EGamma HLT studies.
