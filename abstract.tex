This report summarises the work done by Ram Krishna Sharma in the CMS group of the Institute of High Energy Physics,
with Prof. Mingshui Chen, from September 2022 to December 2024.
The main focus was on the double Higgs non-resonant production with fully Hadronic final state
of WW$\gamma \gamma$, Higgs to 4 lepton differentical and fiducial cross-section measurement
and vector boson scattering measurement with semi-leptonic WW final state.
Other secondary project includes the studies with the resonant production of Higgs boson
(performed in 2020 with 2017 data, again started with full run-2 data), CPPF, EGamma HLT studies.
