\section{The CMS detector} \label{section:CMS_Detector}

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6\unit{m} internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8\unit{T}. 
Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator 
hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel 
and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description 
of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref.~\cite{CMS:2008xjf}.

Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system. The first level (L1), composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the 
calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100\unit{kHz} within a fixed latency of about 4\mus~\cite{CMS:2020cmk}. The second level, 
known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, 
and reduces the event rate to around 1\unit{kHz} before data storage~\cite{CMS:2016ngn}.

% for now just including a bit on photons since they are the most key object in the analysis since their invariant mass defines our signal region - maybe consider adding 
% additional object info since this analysis uses many objects. 

The electromagnetic calorimeter consists of 75\,848 lead tungstate crystals, which provide coverage in pseudorapidity $\abs{\eta} < 1.48 $ in a barrel region (EB) 
and $1.48 < \abs{\eta} < 3.0$ in two endcap regions (EE). Preshower detectors consisting of two planes of silicon sensors interleaved with a total of $3 X_0$ of 
lead are located in front of each EE detector.

In the barrel section of the ECAL, an energy resolution of about 1\% is achieved for unconverted or late-converting photons in the tens of GeV energy range. 
The energy resolution of the remaining barrel photons is about 1.3\% up to $\abs{\eta} = 1$, changing to about 2.5\% at $\abs{\eta} = 1.4$. In the endcaps, 
the energy resolution is about 2.5\% for unconverted or late-converting photons, and between 3 and 4\% for the other ones~\cite{CMS:2015myp}.

The diphoton mass resolution, as measured in $\PH \to \PGg\PGg$ decays, is typically in the 1--2\% range, depending on the measurement of the photon 
energies in the ECAL and the topology of the photons in the event~\cite{CMS:2020xrn}.

The integrated luminosities for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 data-taking years have 1.2--2.5\% individual uncertainties~\cite{CMS-LUM-17-003,CMS-PAS-LUM-17-004,CMS-PAS-LUM-18-002}, 
while the overall uncertainty for the 2016--2018 period is 1.6\%.
