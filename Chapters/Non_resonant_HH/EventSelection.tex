\section{Event selections} \label{sec:event_selection}

% For all three final states, the aim is to define a phase space in which di-Higgs signal sensitivity is maximized. 

% In order to improve the signal extraction, methods involving DNNs were utilized. 

% After event categorization is performed, a combined fit of the simulated \mgg distribution templates to data is performed simultaneously in all categories.

% The number of leptons per event is used to ensure that an event cannot fall into multiple analysis categories. 
% In order to pass the FH, SL, or FL selections, events are required to contain exactly zero, exactly one, or exactly two leptons, respectively. 
% Additionally, all channels are required to contain at least one diphoton candidate based on the photon selections described in Sec. \ref{sec:Objects}.

% \subsection{Fully-leptonic category}

% For events to fall into the FL analysis category, they must contain exactly two oppositely charged leptons ($e^{+}e^{-}$, $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$, $e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}$).
% The leading \pt lepton is required to have \pt $>$ 20$\GeV$, the subleading lepton is required to have \pt $> 10\GeV$, and a distance parameter between the two leading \pt leptons $>$ 0.4 is required.
% Events are rejected from this category if the event contains a third lepton with \pt $> 10\GeV$ in order to avoid saving events with three high energy leptons, as only two 
% are expected from this process. In order to identify events with missing transverse momentum due to the two neutrinos from the 
% leptonically decaying W-bosons, events are required to have $p_T^{miss} > 20 \GeV$. Furthermore, the diphoton candidate in this final state is required to have \pt $> 91 \GeV$, 
% an invariant mass between each electron candidate and photon candidate which is at least 5 GeV different from the invariant Z boson mass to avoid saving Z$\rightarrow\ell\ell$ events. The invariant mass 
% from the two leading leptons is required to be $<$ 80 GeV or $>$ 100 GeV in order to suppress VH(H$\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$) events, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:FL_dilepmass}. In addition, events containing at least one jet 
% with a b-tagging score greater than a medium working point are removed. The reason a b-veto is applied in this final state and not for the SL and FH final states is because this final state applies 
% a cut-based selection, and therefore we choose to apply a b-veto as part of the final selections.
