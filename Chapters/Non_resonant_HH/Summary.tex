\section{Summary} \label{section:Summary}

In this article, the first search for Higgs pair production in the WW$\gamma\gamma$ final state performed by the CMS collaboration has been presented. The analysis makes use of 
data collected with the CMS detector between 2016 and 2018 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 \unit{fb}$^{-1}$, from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.
Combining all final state categories, which makes use of all three WW decay modes, results in an observed (expected) 95\% $CL_{s}$ upper limit on the di-Higgs production cross-section of 
3.0 (1.7) pb, corresponding to about 97 (53) times the standard model prediction. Scans of modified SM and purely BSM coupling parameters in an EFT framework result in an
observed (expected) constraint on the Higgs self-coupling of -25.9 (-14.5) to 24.1 (18.4) times its standard model value, and a constraint on the magnitude of the 
direct coupling of two top quarks to two Higgs bosons of -2.4 (-1.7) to 2.9 (2.2) at a 95\% $CL_{s}$. Additionally, observed (expected) 95\% $CL_{s}$ upper limits are 
placed on twenty EFT benchmark scenarios ranging from 1.7 - 6.2 (1.0 - 3.9) pb.
