\section{Analysis strategy} \label{sec:AnalysisStrategy}

For all three final states, the aim is to define a phase space in which di-Higgs signal sensitivity is maximized. 

In order to improve the signal extraction, methods involving Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) were utilized for the
FH and SL channels. For the FL channel, a cut based analysis is performed as an MVA approach was deemed unfeasible 
due to low statistics in this channel. 

After event categorization is performed, a combined fit of the simulated $m_{\gamma\gamma}$ distribution templates to data is performed simultaneously in all categories.
