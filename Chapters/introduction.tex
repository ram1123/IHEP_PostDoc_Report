In this report, I am summarising the work done during the two and half year of my post-doctoral position at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), Beijing between Dec 2019 and June 2022. I have primarily worked on three physics analysis. They are 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) measurement with semi-leptonic opposite sign WV (Where V represents W or Z boson, that always forced to decay hadronically)
    \item Double Higgs non-resonant ($HH \rightarrow W^+W^-\gamma\gamma$) and resonant ($HH \rightarrow R \rightarrow W^+W^-\gamma\gamma$) production with fully hadronic final state
    \item Differential and fiducial cross-section measurement with Higgs to 4 lepton channel
\end{itemize}
Apart from the physics analysis, I worked on following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improvement/maintenance of Concentration Pre-Processor Fanout (CPPF) system
    \item High level trigger developments of Electron and Photons
    \item Monte-carlo sample generation with Madgraph
\end{itemize}
In addition of these tasks, I also took some Detector Control System (DCS) shifts at P5, CMS.
