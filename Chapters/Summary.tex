\chapter{Summary}
I have presented my work at IHEP, mainly on the VBS studies with semi-leptonic $W^+W^-jj$ final state, double Higgs resonant and non-resonant production measurement with $WW\gamma\gamma$ fully hadronic final state, differential and fiducial cross-section measurement with Higgs to $4L$ channel, Unpacker and emulator comparison of CPPF.
